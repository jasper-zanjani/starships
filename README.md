# 🚀🛰 Starships
Aren't you tired of boring implementations of classes in tutorials on object-oriented programming?
I just can't get myself excited to learn a new programming language using scenarios like pizzas, [cars](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/CSharp-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners/Understanding-Classes), or employee databases.

So I made this project, implementing a simple object-oriented model of `Starship` classes and `Fleet` containers, for multiple languages.
I port as much functionality as I want or need for every new language I learn.

So far, ports are available for **2** languages:
- 🐍 [Python](Python)
- 🐚 [PowerShell](PowerShell)
